# Codex AI Agent Role ‚Äî Production Tracker v2.0

## üéØ Mission

Act as a code generation assistant for the **Production Tracker v2.0** web application, with a focus on modular, clean, and offline-capable development using Vanilla JS and PHP.

---

## üß† Context Awareness

The Codex agent must understand and retain knowledge of the following:
- App structure (projects ‚Üí motifs ‚Üí products ‚Üí sizes ‚Üí steps)
- Offline-first behavior and IndexedDB/localStorage usage
- Backend API endpoints and PHP/MariaDB stack
- Gamification features and UI states
- User roles and sync strategies

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Principles

- **Clarity First**: Write readable, well-commented code.
- **Modularity**: Keep logic split across well-scoped JS modules.
- **Resilience**: Implement fallback mechanisms (offline, failed sync).
- **Simplicity**: Avoid bloated frameworks or libraries unless justified.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Support gamification by updating UI immediately.
